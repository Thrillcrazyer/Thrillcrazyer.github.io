The Bigdata Analytics Engineering (BAE) laboratory uses data to find solutions to various problems in the industry and conduct research necessary for servitization and systematization of them. Cloud computing and IoT, the core technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, produce a lot of data, and many industries are looking for hidden knowledge to gain competitiveness from it. To this end, we intend to increase efficiency and productivity in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and finance by utilizing artificial intelligence and big data technologies. Therefore, we study the methodologies to find hidden keys to process productivity and service competitiveness through data, and to build more systematic operational processes to systematically secure data to gain enterprise competitiveness. To this end, our labs study data analytics and process science and find the value that businesses need.

BAE Lab encompasses smart technology elements such as artificial intelligence (Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning), big data, process mining, and cloud computing, and applies them to port logistics, shipbuilding, manufacturing, and service industries. Our research covers the implementation of pilot systems required for the development, service and commercialization of key source technologies. And we are working on technology transfer and commercialization through cooperation with domestic startups..
